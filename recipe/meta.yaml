about:
  home: https://github.com/cmacmackin/markdown-include/
  summary: Provides syntax for Python-Markdown which allows for the inclusion of the contents of other Markdown documents.
  description: |
    This is an extension to Python-Markdown which provides an "include" function,
    similar to that found in LaTeX (and also the C pre-processor and Fortran). I
    originally wrote it for my FORD Fortran auto-documentation generator.
